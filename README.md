# About 42 Piscine 

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a
methodology that develops both computing and life skills. Where you put your frustration management to the test and see where your limits are and how you overcome them. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is
approved in its selection process. The so-called "C Piscine", a 26-day C and Shell programming bootcamp, without schedules "its up to you"
is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a 42's student.

# Skills developed at C Piscine
 
  # Hard-skills
## C Language
	The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
	pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
	including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

## Shell
	The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
	shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

## Git
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
	be at ease with such a system.
